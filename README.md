*Ananas* uses two identical PCBs to create an interesting three-dimensional construction. Each quadrant of the spherical shape contains its own three LED flasher. The flasher is a discrete circuit based around NPN transistors, resistors and capacitors.

# How to build files

These files are produced using [PCBmodE](https://github.com/boldport/pcbmode). It is a printed circuit board design Python script that creates an SVG from JSON input files, and then creates Gerber and Excellon files for manufacturing. See PCBmodE repository for instructions on how to build files into gerbers.
