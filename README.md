# Ananas

*Ananas* uses two identical PCBs to create an interesting three-dimensional construction. Each quadrant of the spherical shape contains its own three LED flasher. The flasher is a discrete circuit based around NPN transistors, resistors and capacitors. This project is produced and built using [PCBmodE](https://github.com/boldport/pcbmode).
